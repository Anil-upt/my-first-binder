    "Faculty and students often deal with large datasets in biochemistry. For example, we might go online and run a BLAST search to identify a protein sequence. The default BLAST parameters are designed to limit the amount of data we receive to 100 sequences. In many cases this is more than sufficient, and we can stay out of \"Big Data\" weeds so to speak. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, protein (and nucleotide) sequences are rich with information, and there is much knowledge to be gained about evolutionary relationships between proteins using Big Data. Processing large datasets often requires specialized software packages. \n",

    "This workshop will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Give a brief overview of using Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "* Introduce you to several software packages and file formats we will use for analysis\n",
    "* Walk you through uploading and processing fasta files\n",
    "* Show you how to reduce large sequence datasets into diverse, yet manageable sets\n",
    "* Demonstrate how visualization of sequence similarity networks can provide important and novel information about proteins\n",
    "* Leave you with a computational lab experience that can be tailored to your interests!\n",

    "Jupyter notebooks provide an interactive, web-based programming environment. There are many benefits of using a Jupyter notebook in your classroom or lab, including access to a variety of Big Data programming tools (code sections) and the ability to include narrative sections (such as this one, also called a markdown section). This notebook is based on the Python 3 programming language. Throughout this workshop you will encounter code that is represented like this:\n",

    "`print(\"This is some python code.\")`\n",
    "\n",
    "I try to explain all the code in these markdown sections. The print statement simply prints whatever is in between the quotes. The box below this one is a code section. You can simply copy and paste the code into the box below. Its the line that starts with In [ ]:\n",
