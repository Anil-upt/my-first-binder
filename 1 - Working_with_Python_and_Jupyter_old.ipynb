    "Faculty and students often deal with large datasets in biochemistry. For example, we might go online and run a BLAST search to identify a protein sequence. The default BLAST parameters are designed to limit the amount of data we receive to 100 sequences. In many cases this is more than sufficient, and we can stay out of \"Big Data\" weeds so to speak. \n",
